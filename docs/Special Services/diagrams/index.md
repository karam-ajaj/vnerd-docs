# Docker Stack Diagrams

This section documents how the Docker Swarm stack diagrams are generated and kept in sync with the site. The diagrams help readers quickly understand each stackâ€™s topology and how services relate.

## How it works

- We use the container `pmsipilot/docker-compose-viz` (Graphviz under the hood) to render images from Compose/Swarm YAML.
- A simple script renders every stack and copies the images to the docs assets:
	- Script: `docs/assets/diagrams/temp/generate_script.sh`
	- Source YAMLs: `/swarm/config/docs/github-repos/portainer-compose/stacks/*.yml`
	- Output images: `docs/assets/diagrams/<stack>.png`

On each stack page, images are referenced like:

```markdown
![<stack> diagram](../assets/diagrams/<stack>.png){ loading=lazy }
```

## Prerequisites

- Docker is available on the host where you run the script
- Access to the paths used in the script (mounted or present on that host):
	- `/swarm/config/docs/github-repos/portainer-compose/stacks`
	- `/swarm/config/docs/docs/assets/diagrams`
- Network access to pull `pmsipilot/docker-compose-viz` (first run)

## Regenerate all diagrams

Run the script from any shell on a host that can access the above paths:

```bash
bash docs/assets/diagrams/temp/generate_script.sh
```

What it does:

1. Lists all `*.yml` files in `/swarm/config/docs/github-repos/portainer-compose/stacks`
2. Renders each file with `pmsipilot/docker-compose-viz`
3. Writes images to `docs/assets/diagrams/<stack>.png`
4. Copies the full diagrams folder back to the `portainer-compose/diagrams` directory for reference

## Render a single diagram (optional)

You can manually render one stack to validate output before running the full script:

```bash
cd /swarm/config/docs/docs/assets/diagrams/temp
cp /swarm/config/docs/github-repos/portainer-compose/stacks/<stack>.yml docker-compose.yml
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/input pmsipilot/docker-compose-viz render -m image -r --force docker-compose.yml
mv docker-compose.png ../<stack>.png
```

## Troubleshooting

- No image produced
	- Check that `docker-compose.yml` exists in the temp folder before rendering
	- Validate the YAML: unsupported Compose keys or syntax errors can stop rendering
	- Run the renderer without redirecting output to see errors
- Wrong or missing paths
	- Verify the paths in the script match your environment (they use `/swarm/config/docs/...`)
- Permissions
	- Ensure write access to `docs/assets/diagrams`

## Notes

- Images are used purely for documentation. They may not show dynamic runtime state (e.g., scaled replicas) unless defined in YAML.
- Keep stack names in `stacks/<name>.yml` aligned with the desired `<name>.png` to avoid broken image links in pages.

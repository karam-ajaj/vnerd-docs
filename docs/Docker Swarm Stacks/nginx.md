![nginx diagram](../assets/diagrams/nginx.png){ loading=lazy }

[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) is a high-performance web server, reverse proxy, and load balancer known for its speed, scalability, and reliability. Widely used by web developers and system administrators, Nginx is capable of handling large volumes of concurrent connections while consuming minimal system resources. It excels in serving static content, handling dynamic requests, and efficiently distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers.

## Key Features

- **High Performance:** Nginx is designed to deliver exceptional performance and low-latency responses, making it ideal for high-traffic websites and applications.
- **Reverse Proxy:** Nginx can act as a reverse proxy, forwarding requests from clients to backend servers, and delivering responses back to clients, enhancing security and performance.
- **Load Balancing:** Nginx provides built-in load balancing capabilities, enabling distribution of incoming traffic across multiple servers to optimize resource utilization and maintain application availability.
- **SSL/TLS Termination:** Nginx supports SSL/TLS termination, allowing it to handle encryption and decryption of HTTPS traffic, enhancing security and offloading SSL processing from backend servers.
- **Flexible Configuration:** Nginx offers a flexible and powerful configuration language, allowing users to define complex routing rules, URL rewriting, caching policies, and more.

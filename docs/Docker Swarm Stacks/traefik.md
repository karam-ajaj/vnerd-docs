# Traefik

The Modern, Dynamic Reverse Proxy

![traefik diagram](../assets/diagrams/traefik.png){ loading=lazy }

[Traefik](https://traefik.io/) stands as a dynamic and modern reverse proxy and load balancer designed for effortlessly managing microservices architectures, container orchestration systems, and traditional web applications. Renowned for its simplicity, flexibility, and native integration with container orchestrators, Traefik is a go-to solution for routing and securing web traffic.

## Key Features

- **Container Native:** Traefik seamlessly integrates with container orchestrators like Docker, Kubernetes, and more, adapting dynamically to changes in your infrastructure.

- **Automatic Discovery:** With built-in support for service discovery, Traefik dynamically detects and configures itself as new services are added or removed, simplifying the management of evolving infrastructures.

- **TLS Termination:** Enhance security with Traefik's native support for TLS termination, allowing easy configuration of SSL certificates for your services.

- **Middleware and Plugins:** Extend functionality through middleware and plugins, enabling additional features such as rate limiting, authentication, and URL rewriting.

## Getting Started

Deploying Traefik is straightforward, especially in containerized environments. The Traefik documentation provides comprehensive guides and examples to help you get started quickly.

## Volumes

```bash
/swarm/config/traefik
/swarm/data/traefik
```

## Deployment
1. create an external attachable network in swarm
2. create constrains on node so the container will always be deployed on the manager node
3. create the NAT rules
4. create the firewall rules
5. deploy this stack

```bash
docker run -d -p 443:8080 -p 80:80 \
    -v $PWD/traefik.yml:/etc/traefik/traefik.yml traefik
```

The traefik.yml file:

```yaml
services:

  traefik:
    # Use the latest v2.2.x Traefik image available
    image: traefik:latest
    ports:
      # Listen on port 80, default for HTTP, necessary to redirect to HTTPS
      - 80:80
      # Listen on port 443, default for HTTPS
      - 443:443
    deploy:
      placement:
        constraints:
          # Make the traefik service run only on the node with this label
          # as the node with it has the volume for the certificates
          - node.labels.traefik-public.traefik-public-certificates == true
      labels:
        # Enable Traefik for this service, to make it available in the public network

        # Use the custom label "traefik.constraint-label=traefik-public"
        # This public Traefik will only use services with this label

    networks:
      # Use the public network created to be shared between Traefik and
      # any other service that needs to be publicly available with HTTPS
      - traefik-public

#volumes:
  # Create a volume to store the certificates, there is a constraint to make sure
  # Traefik is always deployed to the same Docker node with the same volume containing
  # the HTTPS certificates
#  traefik-public-certificates:

networks:
  # Use the previously created public network "traefik-public", shared with other
  # services that need to be publicly available via this Traefik
  traefik-public:
    external: true
```

## Docker swarm file
Edit the deployment parameters, so the stack should be like this 

``` yaml linenums="1" 
--8<-- "/docs/github-repos/portainer-compose/stacks/traefik.yml"
```

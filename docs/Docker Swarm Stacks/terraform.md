# Terraform

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Orchestration Tool

![terraform diagram](../assets/diagrams/terraform.png){ loading=lazy }

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) orchestration tool created by HashiCorp. It allows users to define and provision infrastructure resources using a declarative configuration language, enabling them to manage infrastructure in a predictable and repeatable way across different cloud providers, data centers, and environments.

## Key Features

- **Declarative Configuration:** Terraform uses a declarative configuration language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define infrastructure resources, dependencies, and configurations, allowing users to describe the desired state of their infrastructure.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform treats infrastructure as code, enabling users to version control infrastructure configurations, collaborate on changes, and apply infrastructure changes programmatically using version control systems like Git.
- **Multi-Cloud Support:** Terraform supports multiple cloud providers, including AWS, Azure, Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and others, as well as on-premises infrastructure, enabling users to manage heterogeneous environments with a single tool.
- **Immutable Infrastructure:** Terraform promotes the concept of immutable infrastructure, where infrastructure changes are made by replacing entire resource instances rather than modifying existing instances, ensuring consistency and reproducibility.
- **Resource Graph:** Terraform builds a dependency graph of infrastructure resources based on their configurations, allowing it to determine the optimal order of resource creation, update, and destruction during provisioning and modification.

## Getting Started

To get started with Terraform, download and install the Terraform binary from the [official website](https://www.terraform.io/), and set up your development environment. Follow the provided documentation and tutorials to learn the basics of Terraform configuration, provisioning, and management.

## Community and Support

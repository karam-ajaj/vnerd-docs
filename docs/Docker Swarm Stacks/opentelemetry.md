# OpenTelemetry

Observability Framework for Cloud-Native Applications

![opentelemetry diagram](../assets/diagrams/opentelemetry.png){ loading=lazy }

[OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) is an open-source observability framework designed to simplify the collection, processing, and visualization of telemetry data in cloud-native applications. By providing standardized APIs, instrumentation libraries, and integrations, OpenTelemetry enables developers to capture and correlate metrics, traces, and logs across distributed systems, allowing for comprehensive monitoring, troubleshooting, and performance optimization.

## Key Features

- **Unified Observability:** OpenTelemetry offers a unified approach to observability, combining metrics, traces, and logs into a single cohesive framework for holistic visibility into application performance and behavior.
- **Standardized APIs:** OpenTelemetry provides standardized APIs for instrumenting code and capturing telemetry data, ensuring consistency and compatibility across different programming languages and environments.
- **Distributed Tracing:** OpenTelemetry supports distributed tracing, allowing developers to trace requests and transactions across microservices and distributed systems, enabling end-to-end visibility and latency analysis.
- **Automatic Instrumentation:** OpenTelemetry instrumentation libraries automatically capture telemetry data from supported frameworks, libraries, and protocols, reducing the need for manual instrumentation and configuration.
- **Integration Ecosystem:** OpenTelemetry integrates with popular observability tools and platforms, such as Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, and Zipkin, providing seamless interoperability and extensibility.

## Getting Started

To get started with OpenTelemetry, visit the [official website](https://opentelemetry.io/) for installation instructions, documentation, and resources. The website provides guides and tutorials for instrumenting applications, configuring data collectors, and visualizing telemetry data using supported backends and visualization tools.

## Community and Support

Join the OpenTelemetry community on [GitHub](https://github.com/open-telemetry) to engage with other users, contribute to the project, and stay informed about the latest updates and developments. Participate in community discussions, share feedback, and collaborate on improving and advancing the OpenTelemetry framework.

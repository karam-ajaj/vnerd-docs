# Teleport

Secure Access for Infrastructure

![teleport diagram](../assets/diagrams/teleport.png){ loading=lazy }

[Teleport](https://goteleport.com/) is an open-source, cloud-native, and multi-platform solution for secure access to infrastructure and applications across distributed environments. Designed to simplify and enhance access controls, Teleport provides a unified gateway for developers and system administrators to securely access servers, containers, databases, and Kubernetes clusters without exposing sensitive credentials or compromising security.

## Key Features

- **Zero Trust Access:** Teleport implements a zero-trust security model, authenticating and authorizing access requests based on user identity, role, and device trustworthiness, rather than network location or IP address.
- **SSH and Kubernetes Access:** Teleport supports secure SSH access to servers and containers, as well as role-based access control (RBAC) and audit logging for Kubernetes clusters, providing a unified access control plane for both traditional and cloud-native environments.
- **Session Recording and Playback:** Teleport records SSH and Kubernetes sessions, allowing administrators to audit user activities, monitor commands, and replay sessions for troubleshooting and forensic analysis.
- **Certificate-Based Authentication:** Teleport uses short-lived X.509 certificates for authentication and authorization, eliminating the need for long-lived credentials and reducing the attack surface.
- **Audit Logging and Compliance:** Teleport generates detailed audit logs of user activities, access requests, and system events, facilitating compliance with regulatory requirements and security best practices.

# Authelia

Open-Source Authentication and Authorization Server

![authelia diagram](../assets/diagrams/authelia.png){ loading=lazy }

Authelia, an open-source authentication and authorization server, is designed to fortify the security of web applications and services. With a focus on simplicity and extensibility, Authelia serves as a robust solution for implementing single sign-on (SSO), two-factor authentication (2FA), and fine-grained access control policies.

## Key Features

- **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Authelia streamlines user access by providing a unified authentication experience across multiple applications.

- **Protocol Support:** Seamlessly integrate with authentication protocols such as LDAP, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect for standardized and secure user authentication.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** Enhance account security with Authelia's support for two-factor authentication, adding an extra layer of verification.

- **Fine-Grained Access Control:** Tailor access control policies based on user roles and permissions, allowing administrators precise control over resource accessibility.

```

You will need to register a device for second factor authentication and confirm by clicking on a link sent by email
Upon registering, you can grab this link easily by running the following command:

```bash
grep -Eo '"https://.*" ' ./authelia/notification.txt.
```

## docker swarm file

``` yaml linenums="1" 
--8<-- "/docs/github-repos/portainer-compose/stacks/authelia.yml"
```

## Notes
To apply the MFA on a website using traefik, you should connect the router to the Authelia middleware by specifying this parameter in the traefik router using labels
```yaml
traefik.http.routers.{service_name}-https.middlewares: authelia@docker
```

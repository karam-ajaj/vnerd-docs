![swarmprom diagram](../assets/diagrams/swarmprom.png){ loading=lazy }

[Swarmprom](https://github.com/stefanprodan/swarmprom) is an open-source monitoring and alerting solution designed specifically for Docker Swarm clusters. Built on top of Prometheus, Grafana, and a set of Docker-friendly exporters, Swarmprom provides comprehensive insights into the performance, health, and status of Docker Swarm services and containers, enabling operators to monitor, visualize, and troubleshoot their containerized infrastructure effectively.

## Key Features

- **Prometheus Monitoring:** Swarmprom leverages Prometheus for collecting, storing, and querying time-series metrics from Docker Swarm nodes, services, and containers, enabling real-time monitoring and analysis of cluster performance.
- **Grafana Dashboards:** Swarmprom includes pre-configured Grafana dashboards with built-in visualizations and metrics for monitoring Docker Swarm cluster resources, workloads, and service-level objectives (SLOs).
- **Exporter Integration:** Swarmprom integrates with a range of Docker-friendly exporters, including Node Exporter, cAdvisor, and Docker Swarm Exporter, to collect metrics on system resources, container health, and orchestration insights.
- **Alerting and Notification:** Swarmprom supports alerting and notification mechanisms through Prometheus Alertmanager, allowing operators to define and manage alerts based on predefined thresholds and conditions.
- **Scalability and Extensibility:** Swarmprom is designed for scalability and extensibility, with support for adding custom exporters, dashboards, and alerting rules to meet specific monitoring requirements and use cases.

[phpIPAM](https://phpipam.net/) is an open-source web-based application for managing IP addresses and subnet allocations in an organization's network infrastructure. It provides a centralized platform for tracking IP address assignments, subnet configurations, DNS records, and VLANs, enabling network administrators to efficiently manage and organize their IP address space.

## Key Features

- **Subnetting:** phpIPAM supports IPv4 and IPv6 subnetting, allowing administrators to create hierarchical subnet structures and efficiently allocate IP addresses within each subnet.
- **DNS Management:** phpIPAM integrates with DNS servers to automate DNS record management, including forward and reverse DNS record creation, deletion, and synchronization.
- **VLAN Management:** phpIPAM provides tools for managing VLAN configurations, including VLAN tagging, assignment, and association with IP subnets.

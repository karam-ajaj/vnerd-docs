## Volumes
```bash
/swarm/config/swarmpit
/swarm/data/swarmpit
```

## Deployment

Run the following command on a docker swarm node
``` bash
docker run -it --rm \
  --name swarmpit-installer \
  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  swarmpit/install:1.9
```

## Docker swarm file

configure traefik then deply the stack with traefik parameters, then deploy with shared disks as the following yaml file

``` yaml linenums="1" 
--8<-- "/docs/github-repos/portainer-compose/stacks/swarmpit.yml"
```

## Notes

- delete unused local volumes (may need to reboot the manager first).
```bash
docker volume rm swarmpit_db-data swarmpit_influx-data
```

- agent restart policy is 'none' so it wont keep trying to deploy a container on 386 nodes.
